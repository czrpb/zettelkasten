- REFLECTION: 1:1 with Jon
	- [[Mar 8th, 2023]]
	- reviewed his implementation of `remove` in double-ended queue (DEQ)
		- with a hint & constraint he figured out how to `remove` under the "difficult" condition
			- the "difficult" condition is when we remove from the `back` when that is empty/`[]`
			- hint: need to think "outside the box"
			- constraint: after 1st implementation, only need 1 `Enum.reverse`
